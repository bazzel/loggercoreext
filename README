LoggerCoreExt
=============

Found this peace of code on http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/HowtoConfigureLogging
so I decided to create a plugin for it.

This plugin creates pretty logs:
	[pid] [LEVEL] yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss: message
	
Example:
  logger.debug "Whatever you want..."
  #=> [584] [DEBUG] 2007-12-13 11:32:29:   Member Indexes (0.000000)   SHOW KEYS FROM members
